# WebProxyServer

## To run the Web Proxy Server, run the Server.java file

•	Developed a web proxy server which is able to cache web pages
•	Handles all kinds of objects such as HTML pages, and images 
•	Implements caching with http requests. When the proxy gets a request, it checks if the requested object is cached, and if yes, it returns the object from the cache, without contacting the web server. If the object is not cached, the proxy retrieves the object from the server, returns it to the client and caches a copy for future requests
•	The cached files is stored in the disc
•	Can block/unblock selected website based on the user’s request
