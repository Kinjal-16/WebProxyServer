# WebProxyServer

<pre>
To run the Web Proxy Server, run the Server.java file
•	Developed a web proxy server which is able to cache web pages <br />
•	Handles all kinds of objects such as HTML pages, and images <br />
•	Implements caching with http requests. When the proxy gets a request, it checks if the requested object is cached, and if yes, it returns the object from             &nbsp; the cache, without contacting the web server. If the object is not cached, the proxy retrieves the object from the server, returns it to the client   &nbsp; and caches a copy for future requests <br />
•	The cached files is stored in the disc <br />
•	Can block/unblock selected website based on the user’s request <br />
